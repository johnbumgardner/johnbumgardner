### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software developer at Cisco Systems, where I work with Node, Angular, Python, Amazon Web Services, CircleCI, and Concourse.

In free time, I work on the Fat Free CRM to stay fresh on Ruby, my favorite language.

I also like history, exercising, golfing, and cooking.

Based out of Raleigh, North Carolina.
