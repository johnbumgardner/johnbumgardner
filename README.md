### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a graduate student at NC State University in Computer Engineering. I'm a software developer intern at SAS and I'll be interning at Amazon in the fall. Also, I'm an avid open-source developer, marksman, and politics junkie.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript, React, and Docker. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: email me at john.bumgardner@icloud.com
