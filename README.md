### Hi there 👋

I am a graduate student at NC State University in Computer Engineering. I'm a software developer intern at SAS and I'll be interning at Amazon in the fall. Also, I'm an avid open-source developer, marksman, and politics junkie.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on Expertiza, an open-source learning platform centered around peer learning. I also contribute regularly to Fat Free CRM, an open-source customer relationship managment system. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, React, and Docker.
